# Terrorism-Attack-Analysis
This repository is dedicated to analyzing global terrorism data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. By leveraging data science and visualization techniques, it aims to provide an in-depth understanding of terrorism incidents, including factors such as location, target types, attack methods, and casualties.
# Key features include:

1. Data Collection: Datasets on terrorism incidents from reputable sources.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Scripts for refining raw data into usable formats.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization and summary statistics to identify key patterns.
4. Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning to predict and categorize incidents.
5. Interactive Dashboards: Tools for dynamic exploration of terrorism data.

This project is ideal for data scientists, researchers, and analysts interested in studying terrorism-related trends and their global implications. Collaborations and contributions are welcome!

# Case Study
Given file "terrorismData.csv" It is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. This dataset includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period.

1. Total number of attacks done in this period in India. Find this count as integer.
2. Which Terrorist group was most active in this period in India. Most active means, group which has done maximum number of attacks.
3. Ignore the Unknown group.

# Problem 5: Terror Frequency
